<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	Sometimes things happen in your life that you cannot help but be amazed at the irony. My parents cobbled up all their live's saving to send me to university in the UK. A 19 year should not make a 60,000 pounds investment decision. My honest opinion was that university was a rip off for someone like me - if you locked me in a basement and gave me my books I would not stop learning - the only reason university was important was because my parents would not allow me to read books living in their basement. 
	</p>
	<p>
	So whenever I have a difficult decision to make, I open a spreadsheet. I did the same when I wanted to go to university, I was not moved by prestige or recognition. So the choices I had to make was choosing the least terrible option. The spreadsheet gave me a clear winner - It had to be a University in the UK. Compared to the United States, Canada, Australia - the UK provided the most value - the main driver for that value was the fact that I finished my BEng in 3 years rather than 4 and in some cases 5 years.
	</p>
	<p> However I knew then what became true now, its impossible for graduates to get jobs in the UK. It has been a bitter 2 months looking for jobs locally. The thing that made it hurtful was the fact that you were not even looked at as a potential employee due to commiting the grave sin of being born in the wrong piece of dirt. After all that effort and sleepless night, when your parents told you hardwork will pay off. 
</p>
<p>
	It was not made better by the fact that international students have their visa restricted for work and had to every 4 months stop up at a center for "monitoring purposes". It reminded me of what I read in WW2 books about Nazi Germany, or the famous book by George Orwell - 1984. 
</p>
<p>
The good thing is the world is a much bigger place than the UK, and I do not think I need to further subject myself to this treatment - especially since the skills that I have is eating the world. I was also not driven by money - I spent 6 months living in a hut with my grandma with no electricity and then the next 6 months 4 miles from the world's tallest building - in one of the most richest neighbourhood on the planet. I knew from that experience that it does not take much to build your own wealth - so companies like JPMorgan do not move me at all - to me they represent old money, I was more interested in building my own world. This is why what I am driven by is mostly the deep desire for knowledge. 
</p>
<h2>Career Interactive</h2>
<p>
So while I have been preparing my exit strategy from the UK - selling my suff on gumtree I see an interesting ad on stackoverflow ( my favourite website ). I usually filter by JavaScript since that is my love. I was not interested in the title or company profile. The thing that made me hit the apply button was two words "visa sponsorship".
</p>
<p>
	I get a call the next day and I was extremely surprised to say the least. The technicalies were not something I was phased by  - being someone who breaths JavaScript. I was happy finally to have found someone who shares the same deep love for programming. The only other person I felt as connected to was the engineers at netflix - a company that I deeply admire. However it was more like stalking them rather then any form of friendship.
</p>
<p>
	Looking at their webiste the first thing that struck me was the irony of what they were doing. Really ? They help international students. I am a international student ! Am I a customer or a potential employee. Wait, if I am a customer then its against their interest - but then again I would be their customer ?
	
	</p>
	<p>
	 I personally know at least 7-8 international student who have no support. They are graduating near top of their class - one even spent his summer learning german since he is done with the UK. The best  ( overall 75% marks in MEng ) - a mechanical engineering student who interned with Toyota in brussel is back living in his parent's basement in India. While I have a native friend who barely passed doing two jobs ( one part time and one full time ) earning 40,000 pounds. I know that I am in no position to provide critisim as a foreigner, but it seemed extremely unfair. The finance person in me saw a massive arbritage and who ever takes advantage of this market ineffiency would make bank. 
</p>
<p>
Career Interactive was tackling the same problem I was facing ! and countless other students who stay silent. As a student who has seen the deep end of this problem. I think I can provide them help in two ways - One from a business model prespective and another from the technology side. This is why my report is divided into two modes. Even though I think technology is important, technology is mostly an enabler, my feedback for their business model would be much more valuable.
</p>
<h2>Business Model</h2>
<h3>Market Maker for Labour</h3>
<p>
	I think Career interactive has a bright future as a company. If they can leverage technology well enough they could replace the entire recruitment industry, and  absorb a huge amount of value from brick and motar universities itself.
</p>
<p>
	I do not want to be critical of my alma master, its also not their fault for not responding to changes in government laws. But I was under the impression that there would be help to get me employment after I put in the hardwork. If knowledge and lectures was all that was provided I could have just stayed home - there is a reason I traveled all the way from the middle east. Left my parents, family and friends. Just so that I could one day get the opportunity to provide value to society. I feel many other international students are in the same boat. 
</p>
<p>
	For Career Interactive - these are your customers. I hope you understand what many international students feel. Having said that - notice that many UK unversities heavily market in the countries that international students come from. I remember when I was in Dubai - UK universities used to set up huge ad campaign. The thing that bothered me about those is there were no rules and regulations for false advertisement - if you did you research you could see through them but many students did not have the tools to do such a thing. If a company or insitution advertises a product to be something and it is not that - its technically fraud. 
</p>
<p>
	However due to the global nature of this tranaction - many UK universities get away with it since there is no quality control mechanism.
</p>
<p>
	Career Interactive needs to be at these booths - espeically the large events that attract 1000s of students in big countries like China. It needs to show the important of its services that these universities clearly do not advertise. Espeically for international students who plan on finding work in the UK. Many students want exactly what career interactive is offering but think the universities will provide it for them - it will also allow career interactive to gather valuable data that will help keep universities honest - Barack Obama recently published all graduation and employement data for US universities as a way to force quality control. UK universities do not face similar pressure - but Career Interactive is in an amazing position to help international students. The trickly bit is the relationship career interactive has with universities. Since Career interactive will essentially became adam smith's invisible hand but for large educational institution.
</p>
<h3>Sell Algorithms and Data</h3>
<p>
	I think I would not be a customer for career interactive, and I mean it in the nicest possible way. What makes google irreplaceable and facebook a fad is that google and netflix sell things that is not easy to copy. 
</p>
<p>
	Career Interactive has access to data and a network that is much more valuable then just coaching. For me as an international student - the thing that I need - for which I will pay real money for, is helping me connect to companies that need javascipt developers which also provide visa sponsorship. Notice that its a filter and search problem. To be more specific - the Home Office provides a huge list of companies that has liceanse. I tried manually going through that list but gave up after 4 days. Figuring out how to analyse that pool that data is a real technical problem. Solving it is a gold mine - similar to what google does with web-pages. 
</p>
<p>
	Creating the software infrasture to analyse that list of companies is just the tip of the iceburg - each of those companies has vacancies. Each of those vacancies has a list of skill requirements. Again if we apply a market based model - those companies are customers with demand and the clients are potential students - domestic and international. Whoever creates the market infrastructure to allow the efficient exchange of labour will create a lot of value. This will also give career interactive data to compare different university degree program - provide statistics and potential employee for each degree. Imagine a situation where a company can tell an international student like myself who is ready to invest 60,000 pounds what exact courses and direction I could take to maximize my potential to work for their company. They could provide small internships that cost them nothing - incrmentally to prepare me to work for them. Or they could outsource any training that a student lacks to career intractive. 
</p>
<p>This type of thinking with algorithms and data as the core product to sell will allow aggresive expansion globally with very little capital and labour investment. WhatsApps was just 50 employee when they sold themselves to facebook for 23 billion dollars. 
</p>

<h2>Website</h2>
	<p>
		Based on my above thinking it should be no surprise to you that the most interesting part of the website from which I derived value from was the blog. It had a lot of interesting facts about the UK job market. What your company is doing is great, and it might be what many students are looking for - especially ones who are interested in working in london. But I personally have no strong attachment to london, banking, etc. My main concern is becoming an expert in Artificial Intelligence - which can easily be done from a village or from an overpriced city like london. I have about 200 pounds in the bank so its not like I will be able to afford some of the programs. Its cheaper for me to do graduate school in canada (5000 pounds per year - including accomodation) and get their 3 year work permit.
	</p>
	<p>
		Due to the shortage of time - I did the best I could to analyse your website. I think the website  is great and you might actually not need me since the services you are providing are adaquete for the direction of your business. I am surpsied that its only Ernest working on the whole thing. However as a front-end developer I would make some changes.

		I created a <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHmcfO8Ke74">youtube video</a> for an interview and assignment provided by a company in central london - you should check it out. I did only using my cheap phone and laptop - as a business you should be able to afford better.
