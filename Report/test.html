<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
At the start of the year I was tasked to solve problems involving robotics and computer vision. The combined application of which is related to real-time manufacturing for automobiles. Most of the software infrastructure related to the robotics part is created using IronPython. However I decided to use Web Technologies ( namely HTML/CSS/Javascript) to develop the computer vision part of the project.
</p>
<h2>
	Developer Operations
</h2>
<h3>Browserify</h3>
<p>
	The application is structured as a <code>node.js</code> application using the <CODE>require</CODE> syntax. Initially the application was run only using atom-shell - A stripped down chrome execution created by github. However for the purposes of this project I have to make sure it runs on the browser. For this reason I used a popular <code>node.js</code> library called <code>browserify.js</code> that packages your source file into a target file with its dependencies. Now its possible to include your file in a script tag and to access the module you again use the <code>require</code> syntax.
</p>
<p>
	The main strength of browserify lies in the the same advantage provided by <code>node</code> and <code>npm</code>.
	It takes care of circular-dependencies.
</p>

  As you can see dependencies graph for a script can grow quite complex with high instances of reuse ability
  </figcaption>
</figure>
</center>
<h3>LiveScript</h3>
<p>
	Livescript is a simple language that compiles down to javascript. The main advantage of Livescript is it adds syntactic sugar to make it easier to do functional type programming.Javascript syntax is derived from the algo family of programming langauge which are mostly imperative  however javascript also allows you to write functional style programming like the languages from the ML family however the syntax is quite different from the languages of that family ( haskell,etc ).Livescript files end with the extension <code>.ls</code> and all my source code is written in Livescript - expect for one module that I had to write in pure javascript for squeezing out performance for my algorithms.
</p>
<h2>Control Flow and Module Structure </h2>
<p>To help navigate the control flow of my application I have drawn a simple diagram showing a rough structure of how the different files relate to each other.</p>
<center>
	<figure>
  <img style = "width:100%;" src="/images/source.jpg">
  <figcaption caption = "source" > Graph showing source Map for the different modules present in the application. Each module is specialized to do a certain task for the application. ( Arrows represent approximate control flow )
  </figcaption>
</figure>
</center>
<ol>
	<li>
		<code>Main.ls</code>
		<p>The main entry point for the application. The logic for the application is structured using a MVC pattern that is quite popular among modern web-developers. The application contains a global object called <CODE>app</CODE> that has two methods <CODE>app.controller</CODE> - acts a intermediate data-structure that holds all our getters and setter methods and <code>app.view</code> - which contains our <CODE>HTML</CODE> logic</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>Camera.ls</code>
		<p>
			This module holds roughly all the logic that does canvas manipulation and finding all the cameras on your computer. Its main function is to signal which of the lower level functions needs to called. The module is highly stateful  with a lot of variables - it was not possibel to avoid having to do this due to the nature of GUIs that tend to have many different path of execution.
		</p>

	</li>
	<li>
		<CODE>Pure.js</CODE>
		<p>
			This module contains very few methods. Some of the methods are for drawing onto the canvas but the others are related to computer vision. Mainly for tasks such as gray-scale filter.
		</p>

	</li>
	<li>
		<CODE>MaxMath.ls</CODE>
		<p>
		Similar to <CODE>Pure.js</CODE> but implements a algorithm from graph theory for maximizing matches on a weighted bipartite graph.
		</p>
<li><CODE>CSS.ls</CODE>
	<p>
		This module contains all the <code>CSS</code> related logic for our GUI. We expose the module in <CODE>Main.ls</CODE>
	</p>
</li>

	</li>
</ol>
<h2>Externa Libraries</h2>

	<p>
		For creating this application I have used three external libraries.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<code>Lodash.js</code>
			<p>
				<code>Lodash.js</code> is a successor to a very popular utility module called <code>underscore.js</code>. The main difference lies in the fact that <code>Lodash.js</code> was created with performance in mind. It also extends the functionality of <code>underscore.js</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Both the libraries act as the defacto standard libraries for programmers who do functional programming in javascript. They provide utility method that are similar to what you would find in the standard libraries of programming languages like Haskell or scheme.
			</p>
					</li>
			<li>GASP
			<p>
				GSAP is a collection of javascript animation libraries. I have mainly used the functionality provided by <code>TweenMax.js</code>. GSAP emphasis is performance when it comes to animation. I have found animating using GSAP to be much more responsive then animating using any other means. It also gives me fine control on my animation.
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>mithril.js</code>
				<p>
					This is a MVC library that was inspired by the library created by <code>facebook</code> for doing bi-directional data binding on DOM elements. After a lot of empirical benchmarks the engineers at <code>facebook</code> realized that doing DOM manipulation was expensive while javascript was much faster. Based on this idea they created <code>react.js</code> and it proved to be quite performant and simple compared to its competition. However I refrained from using <code>react.js</code> mainly because the library requires use to use a custom <code>HTML</code> like language called <code>JSX</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					<code>mithril.js</code> takes the idea of virtual DOM from <code>react.js</code> however it doen't use <code>JSX</code> or any <code>XML</code> like language but pure <code>JSON</code> and <code>Array</code> structure to represent its view.
					This idea to me was very elegant since  objects and arrays are the most fundamental data-structures in comptuter science.
				</p>
			</li>

	</ol>
	<h3>Compiling External Libraries </h3>
	<center>
	<figure>
  <img style = "width:100%;" src="/images/headerls.jpg">
  <figcaption caption = "external" > Schematic showing how the external libraries are compiled.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
</center>
	<p>
		 The above diagram shows the process of compilation for our external libraries. The process was inspired by C where we have a header file containing links to all our script files. In our case browserify takes care of arranging them so that we can <code>require</code>our external libraries while we are in the browser environment.
	</p>

<h2>Using The Application</h2>
	<p>
		The most tested way to start the application is to download the <code>http-server</code> module from <code>npm</code>
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			If you have <code>npm</code> and <code>node</code> installed you need to just type ( note: this is a global installation due to the <code>-g</code> flag):
		</li>
			<center>
		<p>
		<code>npm install -g http-server</code>
		</p>
		</center>
				<li>
				After installing navitage to the directory containing <code>index.html</code> and type on the terminal
				<p>
					<center><code>http-server</code></center>
				</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			Notice the port number that is displayed on your terminal and then open browser and type on the address bar - where {port number} is a placeholder for the port number that is observed on the terminal.
			<p>
				<center>
				<b>localhost:{port number}</b>
				</center>
			</p>
		</li>
	</ol>

</figure>
</center>
<p>
	The application can be started by clicking on "Find Camera" Button on the button right. The rest of the buttons are for exploring the data that is coming from the sensor in various ways. ( Either in Spacial Dimensions or as a Time Series). To start our tracking algorithm we need to click on "Start Tracking"

<h2>Canvas Data Structure</h2>

	<center>
	<figure>
  <img style = "width:100%;" src="/images/Vector1.jpg">
  <figcaption caption = "vector1" > Schematic Diagram of data-structure if we store the data as it it recieved from our algorithm.
  <i>K</i> is the number of Frames. <i>N</i> is the number of Detected Pins
  </figcaption>
</figure>
</center>
<p>
	For the canvas rendering we had an interesting data structure problem that had to be solved.
</p>
<p>
	The data that we get back from our algorithm is a <code>2 x N </code> array ( as shown in the diagram above ). This data structure is returned every frame ( 35 millisecond ). We need to find an efficient way to store this data so that we can render our canvas. If we store the data as it is we run into performance problem. It can be intuitively seen that for our canvas to render each graph line it needs to traverse an array of <i>K</i> elements each of which are not stored in a contiguous array. For movement between each array element we need to do an extra lookup on a <i>separate</i> array. Notice that we never have to travel vertically down our data structure so storing it in this form is reductant.
</p>

	<center>
	<figure>
  <img style = "width:100%;" src="/images/Vector2.jpg">
  <figcaption caption = "vector1" > Schematic Diagram of data-structure after rearranging ( NOTE:
  <i>n</i> is the number of Frames. <i>K</i> is the number of Detected Pins - opposite of previous graph)
  </figcaption>
</figure>
</center>
<p>
The solution to this problem is the data structure shown above. Where we re-arrange our array to store all XY position for each pin in a contiguous array. This reduces the lookup needed for our inner while loop improving the speed of our rendering significantly.
</p>
<h2>
	Use of Inkspace and Gimp
</h2>

<p>
	All the figures on this page were created using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illusrator. I have played around with Ink space and GIMP and found them to be really good pieces of open source tools. However I have gained a lot of proficiency in using Adobe Photo-shop and Adobe Illustrator so did not feel it was nessenry to do my diagrams in a new software. I created most of the digram using the photo shop brush tool and a tablet for free-hand drawing. The background grid was created using illustrator and rendered as a <code>.jpg</code>. The final vector diagrams were created in illustrator and then saved as a <code>.jpg</code>. I used the line tool and the rectangle tool for it.
</p>
<h2>Opening report in HTML</h2>
<p>
	This report was written in a custom designed HTML. It it an partial attempt to create a latex -> html parser.
</p>
<p>
	This report can be opened in the same method as the application using <code>http-server</code> in the directory where the <code>index.html</code> is stored.
</p>
<h2> For Marker </h2>
<p>
All the files I expressed above as source files have code that was written entirely by me. There is a lot of stuff that can said about the different things that were done. The main time consuming aspect was making javascript performant ( under 35 millisecond ).  Writing elaborate for loops and finding shortcuts to reduce the algorithm lookup took a lot of time to figure out. Sometimes simple things like not using the <code>Math</code> library improved the performance be a large amount.
</p>
<p>
	I have used array buffers also to improve performance.
</p>
<!-- <p>
	The web has come a long since the days of Netscape. The internet is no more restricted to just desktop but is available in devices of various sizes and shapes. The gateway to the internet for most people is their browser. Therefore its not surprising that the amount of development in web-technologies has skyrocketed in the past 5 years. People who might have been experts in web-technologies even 6 years ago will find that modern web is nothing like what it used to be and that is a good thing.
</p>
<p>
	When railways were first introduced an interesting thing happened. Many private companies that were developing trains were not able to come to a conclusion as to what the width of the rail-tracks should be. They also figured by using rail tracks of different widths than other private companies they will be able to maintain a monopoly for the rail-tracks by making it difficult for trains built by other companies to run on their tracks.
</p>
<p>
	This lead to a stagnation in the railway industry for a while until the government got fed up and forced standardization upon the various private companies. This resulted in massive creation of wealth along the different rail-tracks, allowed small players to create their own train that will be able to run on the track.
</p>
<p>
	The reason why this story is really good to remember is because the state of programming for a while has been the same. Various compilers that are not compatible with each other. Various CPU architecture, Operating system , etc. In many ways programmers were forced to learn many different ways to do the same thing that had the same functionality in the real world.
