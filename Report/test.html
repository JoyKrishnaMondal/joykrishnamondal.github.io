<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
At the start of the year I was tasked to solve problems involving robotics and computer vision. The combined application of which is related to real-time manufacturing for automobiles. Most of the software infrastructure related to the robotics part is created using IronPython. However I decided to use Web Technologies ( namely HTML/CSS/Javascript) to develop the computer vision part of the project.

	The application is structured as a <code>node.js</code> application using the <CODE>require</CODE> syntax. Initially the application was run only using atom-shell - A stripped down chrome execution created by github. However for the purposes of this project I have to make sure it runs on the browser. For this reason I used a popular <code>node.js</code> library called <code>browserify.js</code> that packages your source file into a target file with its dependencies. Now its possible to include your file in a script tag and to access the module you again use the <code>require</code> syntax.

	The web has come a long since the days of Netscape. The internet is no more restricted to just desktop but is available in devices of various sizes and shapes. The gateway to the internet for most people is their browser. Therefore its not surprising that the amount of development in web-technologies has skyrocketed in the past 5 years. People who might have been experts in web-technologies even 6 years ago will find that modern web is nothing like what it used to be and that is a good thing.

	When railways were first introduced an interesting thing happened. Many private companies that were developing trains were not able to come to a conclusion as to what the width of the rail-tracks should be. They also figured by using rail tracks of different widths than other private companies they will be able to maintain a monopoly for the rail-tracks by making it difficult for trains built by other companies to run on their tracks.
</p>
<p>
	This lead to a stagnation in the railway industry for a while until the government got fed up and forced standardization upon the various private companies. This resulted in massive creation of wealth along the different rail-tracks, allowed small players to create their own train that will be able to run on the track.

	The reason why this story is really good to remember is because the state of programming for a while has been the same. Various compilers that are not compatible with each other. Various CPU architecture, Operating system , etc. In many ways programmers were forced to learn many different ways to do the same thing that had the same functionality in the real world.
