Tactile Perception would be a key component if fully autonomous robots are to became a reality in the near future. However both tactile perception and autonomy in robots require significant research and study if we need them to have any major application in our industries and society. The specific problem that this project is trying to solve is that of edge and texture detection using a novel new type of tactile sensor. Tactile perception has been left aside for more important study in computer vision for a while in engineering and computational science since it became cheaper to manufacture light sensors than to manufacture expensive touch sensors. However there is only so much information we can use for inference from the electromagnetic spectrum. Its important to point out that data collected from tactile sensors has helped many organims 'win' the evolutionary game, and almost all form of biologcal intelligence we see incorporates inference from data obtained from touch sensors, it may be that we can successfully create fully autonomuos robots without any form of perception of touch but it would be highly unlikely given the results of billions of years of natural evolution. What this means for this project is that even if the application is very specific it can be genrally applied to many more known and unkown problems.
