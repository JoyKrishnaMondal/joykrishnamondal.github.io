<h1>Tacticle Perception with Autonomous Control</h1>

<p>Tactile Perception would be a key component if fully autonomous robots are to became a reality in the near future. However both  tactile perception and autonomy in robots require significant research and study if we need them to have any major application in our industries and society. The specific problem that this project is trying to solve is that of edge and texture detection using a novel new type of tactile sensor. Tactile perception has been left aside for more important study in computer vision for a while in engineering and computational science since it became cheaper to manufacture light sensors than to manufacture expensive touch sensors. However there is only so much information we can use for inference from the electromagnetic spectrum. Its important to point out that data collected from tactile sensors has helped many organims &#39;win&#39; the evolutionary game, and almost all form of biologcal intelligence we see incorporates inference from data obtained from touch sensors, it may be that we can successfully create fully autonomuos robots without any form of perception of touch but it would be highly unlikely given the results of billions of years of natural evolution. What this means for this project is that even if the application is very specific it can be genrally applied to many more known and unkown problems.</p>

<p>The main domain where we do use a lot of robots is a good place to start our investigation on the current state of the art in robotics. This would be in manufacting, however most of it is not autonmouns and requires an army of skilled proffesionals to program each and every task for a robot.The progress we heavye made with general learning algorithms is an tremoundoes feat of modern computational science and engineering, however they have only been widely applied in mostly IT sectors (search engines, spam filters, data mining , etc), there is significant potential for these classes of algorithms to revolutizie conventional heavy industries such as automotive manufacturing.</p>

<p>My technical project is an attempt to solve a specific problem using tactile sensors and an industrial arm that applies directly in quality assurance in the automotive manufacturing process.</p>

<p>Quality assurance in automotive mannufacting generally speaking means assesing the quality of some finished assembly - this assembly could be a car part or a whole car.
Currently this is mostly done by manual inspections by engineers or technicians.
There are two specific task that they are required to be done:</p>

<p>1)To make sure edge contours of the assembly do not have any defects
2)Notify about any  inconsistencies on the surface finishing.</p>

<p>To accomplish this the people inspecting would use approximate prior knowledge about the geometry of the assembly. Usually the engineer would use a CAD model to express the geometry of the assembly.</p>

<p>There has been attempts made to automate both these problems using computer vision but unfortunately it hasnt been successful. THE reason mainly is due to the fact that light intracts in complex ways with both the material and geometry of a surface, there can be diffraction, surface ray-scattering, Subsurface ray-scattering, diffusion, etc . By dectecting the amount of light we recieve after sending a beam can in no way tell us a lot about the surface that is reflecting it, even if we do make some inference it will most likely not be robust and have a lot of uncertainities with it, this problem becames much more naused in materials such as rubber which are genrally very matte and diffuse most of the incoming rays.</p>

<p>Outcomes of Project</p>

<p>There are two main goals of this project</p>

<ol><li>Create a robust algorithm to anaylze sensor data</li><li>create a autonomus control algorithm for the industrial arm</li></ol>

<p>To aid in meeting this goal I have cho</p>
